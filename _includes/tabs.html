<div>

![what_open_data.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/placeholder.png)



<div class="step-text">

Understand what open data is available and how you can help
Browse our status dashboard and map to understand the kinds of data available, and read our advocacy guidance to find out how to create more open data.

</div>
</div>

<!--STEP TWO-->
<div>


![what_open_data.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/placeholder.png)


<div class="step-text">

Decide where you want to put the data
From websites and apps that attract millions of users, through to communities and services that engage local people, there are lots of ways of using OpenActive data.
If you already have a website that engages an audience or an app or a tool, it might make sense to include the data there. It might also make sense for you to build a whole new app, website or service, depending on whether you're a long-term business or a short-term campaign.


</div>

</div>

<!--STEP THREE-->
<div>

![what_open_data.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/placeholder.png)


<div class="step-text">

Decide how you want to consume the open data
There are many white-label widgets available from organisations who make it easy for you to feature open data on any website. There are also aggregators that provide one API to access all the data, and of course you can collect and display the data directly yourself.

</div>

<!--STEP FOUR-->
<div>

![what_open_data.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/placeholder.png)


<div class="step-text">
