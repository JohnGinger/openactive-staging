Playwaze provides a web and app product that helps people to organise all sorts of sports activities in one place – sessions, classes, competitions, teams, members, news, messaging, and payments, and more. It makes it easier for people to organise sport and easier for participants to play.

If you upload a session to Playwaze, you just need to tick the “Promote this activity publicly” box in your activity to publish it as open data. See the screenshot below.
