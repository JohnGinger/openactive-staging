### WHY SHOULD I OPEN MY DATA? WHICH DATA?
We believe the most useful data for consumers is opportunity data.  This is data that describes a physical activity including what it is, where and when it's taking place. Opportunity data includes enough information for a participant to decide whether an activity is right for them.

We are encouraging organisations to openly publish their data, in the same way they currently publish web pages on the internet. Opening up opportunity data according to a commonly agreed standard can make it easier to find and use by others.  Attaching an open licence means that it can be accessed, used and shared by anyone.

While we cannot predict what new services will be created once opportunity data is opened, we will support and encourage new and existing organisations to innovate in response to the needs of consumers.

In the long-term, open opportunity data will help activity providers deliver a better experience and attract and retain customers.  This will help the sector as a whole get people more active. Joining OpenActive now means you can work with the Open Data Institute to shape how we get there.

<div class="one">

### 5 Steps to publishing your data
The steps below are designed for organisations who already have a booking system or website that lists opportunities to be active. If you do not have either of these, but would like to learn more about how to open up your data, please go to our Learn about data page, or contact us.

##### 1) BUILD YOUR OPENACTIVE API
Send the specification details to your technical team, and ask them to open up your session data according to the OpenActive specification. Note this is usually an additional API to any that you may already have, and should be simple to implement. See more
###### (estimated time to complete: 2-3 developer days)

##### 2) CHOOSE A LICENCE
License your data for anyone to access, use and share. The Open Data Institute recommends the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (cc-by) version 4. Inform your tech team. See more
###### (estimated time to complete: 5 minutes)

##### 3) AMEND TERMS AND BUILD OPT-OUT
If you do not own the data (e.g. in the case of a booking system provider), then you need to ensure that you obtain permission to publish the data. See more
###### (booking systems only - estimated time to complete: 30 minutes / 1 developer day)

##### 4) CREATE A DATASET HOMEPAGE
To publish open data for anyone to freely access, use and share, you must create a webpage that describes the data you are publishing. See more
###### (estimated time to complete: 1.5 hours)

##### 5) CREATE AN OPEN DATA CERTIFICATE
The Open Data Institute encourages all publishers to create an Open Data Certificate for any open data published. If your dataset site has been set up correctly, it should automatically populate much of the Open Data Certificate form.
###### (estimated time to complete: 30 minutes)
