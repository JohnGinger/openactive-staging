No. In order for the initiative to become a success, it needs to be self-sustaining and driven by various parts of the sector itself. The ODI aims to provide the knowledge, tools and foundation for open ‘opportunity’ data to thrive independently. Beyond its stewardship role, the ODI will continue to play a collaborative role as an active OpenActive member.

With this future in mind, all tools, documentation, and material have been built by the ODI and OpenActive members with community-led sustainability and maintenance in mind.
