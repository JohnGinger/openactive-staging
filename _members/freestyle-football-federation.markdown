Freestyle Football Federation is the world governing body for freestyle football. It has been established upon a backbone of community development and education. This means we recognise the power this exciting sport has to inspire healthy active lifestyles for young people all over the world. Aside from growing the sport as a full time profession for the athletes, the Federation is committed to teaching key life skills, nutrition and academics through freestyle football.
