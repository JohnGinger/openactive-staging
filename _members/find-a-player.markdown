Find a Player is a smartphone app designed to act as a hub between sports people and events in local areas. We provide local, available players to organisers short of numbers and conversely we show sports people things near them that they might want to get involved in. We also offer a full event organisation system to take the pain out of sending invites, following up friends and tracking numbers. Quite simply we want to make it easier for people to find, organise and play sport at the times and places that suit them best.
