The sport and fitness service provides opportunities for a happier, healthier and more active Calderdale. Our aim is to help Calderdale be the most active borough in the North. Our key challenges are to encourage all residents to be more physically active in any way they choose; to make it easy for our residents to make lifestyle choices that increase activity and improve health; to target inactive people and places to increase participation; and to encourage and enable collaboration and co-creation of initiatives to empower communities.
