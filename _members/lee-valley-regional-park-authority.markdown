Lee Valley Regional Park Authority runs award winning open spaces and sports venues along the 26 mile long, 10,000 acre park. The park was created by a unique Act of Parliament as a "green lung" for London, Essex and Hertfordshire. Our approach is to be community focused and commercially driven, to work with partners to produce a unique combination of activities, sights and experiences.
