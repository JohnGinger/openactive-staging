Our Parks is a brand new initiative bringing free, group exercise classes, led by experienced, fully qualified and insured instructors, to parks near you in partnership with Councils / Local Authorities. It is our aim to ensure that easy access to exercise is available to you and your local community and Our Parks utilises a bespoke technology to enable residents to book and register on classes and communicate with other park users to provide a fitter and socially active community.
