The sport and active lifestyles service provides opportunities for people living in Leeds to enjoy the benefits of an active lifestyle. Our aim is to help Leeds be the most active big city in the United Kingdom. Our two key challenges over the next three years are to increase participation in sport and active lifestyles and to work with partners to reduce health inequalities across the city.
