The Sport and Recreation Alliance is the umbrella body for sport and recreation in the UK and represents 320 members â€“ organisations like The FA, the Rugby Football Union, British Athletics, Ramblers, British Rowing and the Exercise Movement and Dance Partnership. Our role is to speak up on their behalf, represent their views and to provide them with services which make their life easier.
