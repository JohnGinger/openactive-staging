Upshot was initially developed in 2012 to help the hundreds of organisations funded by the Football Foundation, the UK's largest sports charity. It was built with an extremely high degree of flexibility and was designed to be easy to set up and valuable to a wide range of audiences/users. It is a tool to help organisations manage their activities, monitor progress towards goals, and gather evidence of success for funders.
