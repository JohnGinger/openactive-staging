Poplar HARCA is a Housing Association who own and manage around 9,500 homes in Poplar, East London; the majority of these were transferred from the London Borough of Tower Hamlets back in 1998. Since then, we have refurbished all those homes and built almost 1,000 new ones. We invest heavily in making Poplar a great place to live, with 13 community centres and many programmes aimed at engaging the local residents and making Poplar a great place to live. We recognise that tech will play an important part in the future of all sectors and are keen to embrace this revolution and find solutions that bring the most benefit to the end user
