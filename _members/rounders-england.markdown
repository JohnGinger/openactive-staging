Rounders England are the national governing body for Rounders. Rounders is a cross-generational, cross gender game that embraces all abilities. It’s a game that’s all about sociability, about connecting with people in an age where screens separate generations and are replacing real and meaningful interactions. A game of Rounders makes great memories, offering an ideal balance between fun and fitness with great opportunities to make friends, get some exercise and have a good laugh away from the pressures of everyday life. Our new mission ‘Connecting People through Rounders’ is at the heart of all we do.
