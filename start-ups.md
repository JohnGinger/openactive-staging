### Innovating with data for a more physically active future

**The OpenActive Accelerator establishes ready-to-market startups using open data to develop digital products and services that help people get active.**

Building on ODI’s history supporting 120+ innovative data startups worldwide, unlocking over £40m of impact so far, the ODI is now recreating this startup impact achieved in other pioneering transport, retail and finance sectors for sport and physical activity. Focused on making it easier for the millions of people in England teetering on the edge of being regularly active.

> “We’re supporting talented startups working with data who are determined to transform the way people discover and take part in physical activities. It’s hard for people to stay active and it doesn’t have to be. Data will play a huge role in enabling innovation. We’re creating a place for innovators who can make it easier to find information, remove barriers that are stopping people from exercising regularly, and improve the journey of becoming and staying active.
 
> Together with our data expertise, network and support we can validate your ideas into marketable solutions, as we have achieved with over 120 startups worldwide.
 
 
> It’s going to be an exciting journey and we’d love to have you on board to catalase positive change in the sport and physical activity sector. Let’s make it happen.”

### Supporting you to bring your vision to market

The accelerator provides training, mentorship, access to funding and perks within the ODI, Sport England and external partner networks. It also gives access to open data about physical activity opportunities made open for the first time by OpenActive members such as Greenwich Leisure Limited, Lawn Tennis Association and British Cycling.
